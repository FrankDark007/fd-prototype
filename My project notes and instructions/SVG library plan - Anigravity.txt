Flood Doctor SVG Graphics Library Plan

Animation Style Analysis (From Your Videos)

Your existing animations use:

Clean line art / flat design with 2px strokes
Primary Color: Teal/Cyan (#00a0b0)
Secondary Colors: Navy blue (#1e3a5f), Cream (#f5e6c8)
White backgrounds with simple slide-in/fade animations
Subject matter: Homes, furniture, documents, water effects, insurance policies
Can I Create Similar Video Animations? I can create animated SVGs that mimic this style with CSS/SMIL animations. For full MP4 video exports, you'd need to render these through After Effects or a similar tool. However, I can provide:

Animated SVGs (loop infinitely, web-ready)
Lottie JSON files (for high-quality web animations)
Frame-by-frame SVG sequences
